Coefficient of friction:    0.25
Vehicle speed (m/s):        31.3
Vehicle speed (mph):        70.0
Angle of bank of the curve: 20.0
~~~
Centripetal force required: 21416.0 N
Normal Force on Vehicle: 10065.4 N
Force of friction produced: 2516.4 N
Force of gravity against slipping out: 3663.5 N
Difference (Negative means not enough centripetal force and the car will slide out): -15236.2 N
Force of slipping in (Negative means too much centripetal force and car will slide in): -1147.2 N

Torque produced due to friction: 1348.8 N*m
Maximum speed before tipping: 30.1 m/s
Maximum speed before tipping: 67.4 mph
Difference in speeds (negative means the car has tipped): -1.2 m/s
Difference in speeds (negative means the car has tipped): -2.7 mph
